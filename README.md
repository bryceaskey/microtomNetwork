# MicroTom Co-expression Network Analysis
## Overview:
The code in this repository roughly follows the workflow described by Li et al. (2020), and was used to conduct a co-expression analysis in MicroTom tomato. The co-expression network connects metabolite accumulation to gene expression throughout the life cycle of tomato, from seedling to mature fruit. This work was originally submitted as a series of assignments for the class ABE4662: Quantification of Biological Processes. Thus, it is split into 3 projects:

<b>Project 1</b> - Generation of a simple gene network, with a breakdown of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. (Python)

<b>Project 2</b> - Normalization of metabolite data, and separation of metabolites into clusters with k-means clustering. (Python)

<b>Project 3</b> - Integration of the gene network and metabolite clusters into a single co-expression network, and drawing of an interactive network diagram. (Python + R)
